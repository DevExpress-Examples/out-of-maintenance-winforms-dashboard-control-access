This example demonstrates how to customize the controls used to visualize data in the dashboard items at runtime.

![customized-controls](images/customized-controls.png)

The following options are changed:

* [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15150): The **font** is changed to "Arial, 10". For this, handle the [DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlUpdated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlUpdated) event and access the control's [MainView](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl.MainView).
* [Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/14719): The **background color** of the chart pane is set to _LightYellow_. For this, handle the [DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlUpdated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlUpdated) event and acess the control's [Diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraCharts.ChartControl.Diagram) property.
* [Pivot](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15266): Cell values related to "Mountain" products are **hidden**, `###` is displayed instead. The [PivotGridControl.CustomCellValue](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraPivotGrid.PivotGridControl.CustomCellValue), [DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlCreated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlCreated) and [DashboardItemBeforeControlDisposed](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemBeforeControlDisposed) events are handled to customize the cell values.
* [Gauge](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15264): The background color of the first gauge's label is set to "LightGreen", a custom label is set and displayed in "Tahoma, 16" font. The number of major ticks is set to 8. For this, handle the [DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlUpdated](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemControlUpdated) event and use the [Gauges](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGauges.Win.GaugeControlBase.Gauges) property to access the collection of gauges displayed in the control.
